// Lab 10

/* How many bytes are needed to store a linked list of 100 integers? */

/* Each node contains 1 integer and 1 pointer.
 * Thus each node's size will be 4 bytes + 8 bytes = 12 bytes.
 * The first node has a header pointer.

 * In this question, there are 100 integers that make up the linked list.
 * Thus total bytes required to store a linked list of 100 integers is 8 + (100*12) = 1208 bytes */
